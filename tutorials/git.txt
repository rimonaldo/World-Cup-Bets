branching - 
    Let’s go through a simple example of branching and 
    merging with a workflow that you might use in the real world. 
    You’ll follow these steps:

    - Do some work on a website.
    - Create a branch for a new user story you’re working on.
    - Do some work in that branch.

    At this stage, you’ll receive a call that another issue is critical 
    and you need a hotfix. You’ll do the following:

    - Switch to your production branch.
    - Create a branch to add the hotfix.
    - After it’s tested, merge the hotfix branch, and push to production.

    Switch back to your original user story and continue working.

    Basic Branching - 
    First, let’s say you’re working on your project and 
    have a couple of commits already on the master branch.
